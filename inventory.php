<div class="maintext"><div class="titletext">Why this inventory?</div><br>Digital learning resources are linked to memory fixation in the field of elearning, that deals with the use of electronic media to teach people. Above all, when we discuss these digital resources, we discuss electronic representation. Words, sound, static or moving images, and texts are used for instruction it. Design and programming usually come into play when creating electronic representations. <b>This inventory's goal is to provide a non-exhaustive overview of the various digital teaching methods available.</b> Moreover, to describe how these technologies help fix information in the memory. to establish standards in a field where everything qualifies as Elearning.<br><br>
Compared to traditional learning, e-learning has some benefits. The two most notable ones are the lowering of distance barriers and the control of timing. We will choose the simplest solution based on these presumptions and will not rely on the teacher's presence either in real time or asynchronously.<br><br>We must realize that a digital or analog learning process might be complex and is typically conditioned by various external elements in order to frighten away the promises of an ideal world.<br><br> Electronic learning materials and psychological learning aids.<br><br> In order to generate the inventory, we will connect psychological concepts like memory fixation and e-learning aspects produced through programming and design.<br><br>

        <p class="date"> Combining visual, auditory, and interactive elements</p>
        <p class="text">The presentation of information in eLearning plays a pivotal role in shaping the learning experience and maximizing knowledge retention. In a digital realm where attention spans can be fleeting, the design, layout, and delivery of content significantly impact a learner's engagement and comprehension. </p>

        <p class="date">Active recall, promoting deeper understanding</p>
        <p class="text">When we actively retrieve information, we engage in a process of retrieval-induced forgetting and subsequent re-learning. This process reinforces the neural connections associated with the retrieved information, making it more durable and accessible over time.</p>

        <p class="text">Emotions are closely tied to memory consolidation. Emotional experiences tend to be remembered more vividly and retained for longer periods.The amygdala, a key brain structure involved in processing emotions, interacts with memory systems, leading to stronger encoding of emotionally charged information. </p>

        <p class="date">Involves alternating between different topics or skills</p>
        <p class="text">The importance of interleaving lies in its capacity to promote effective learning through the generation of connections and comparisons. By mixing related concepts or skills, learners are challenged to differentiate and discern the subtle nuances that distinguish each item.</p>
